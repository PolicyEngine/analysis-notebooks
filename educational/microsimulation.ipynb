    "This notebook advances from household-level analysis to economy-wide microsimulation, the foundation of PolicyEngine's impact estimation system. While Notebook 1 showed how to analyze individual households, this notebook demonstrates how to:\n",

    "- Scale from households to entire populations using representative samples\n",
    "- Understand and apply survey weights for accurate population estimates  \n",
    "- Design complex parametric reforms with time-varying parameters\n",
