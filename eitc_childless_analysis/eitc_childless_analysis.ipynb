   "source": "## State EITC Programs\n\nAs of 2024, **31 states plus DC** have state-level Earned Income Tax Credit programs. Most states calculate their EITC as a simple percentage match of the federal EITC, but several have unique structures.\n\n### States with Standard Federal Match Structure\nThese states calculate their state EITC as a percentage of the federal EITC amount:\n\n| State | Match % | Refundable | Notes |\n|-------|---------|------------|-------|\n| CO | 50% (2024) | Yes | Phasing down to 10% by 2034 |\n| CT | ~30% | Yes | |\n| DC | 70% | Yes | Higher match for childless workers |\n| DE | 4.5% ref / 20% non-ref | Choice | Taxpayers choose refundable OR non-refundable |\n| HI | 40% | Yes | |\n| IL | 20% | Yes | |\n| IN | 10% | Yes | |\n| IA | 15% | Yes | |\n| KS | 17% | Yes | |\n| LA | 5% | Yes | |\n| ME | 50% | Yes | |\n| MA | 40% | Yes | |\n| MI | 30% | Yes | |\n| MO | 20% | Yes | Called \"Working Families Tax Credit\" |\n| MT | 10% | Yes | |\n| NE | 10% | Yes | |\n| NJ | Variable | Yes | Varies by income |\n| NM | ~25% | Yes | |\n| NY | 30% | Yes | Plus supplemental credit |\n| OH | 30% | Yes | |\n| OK | 5% | Yes | Lowest in nation |\n| OR | 9-12% | Yes | Varies by children |\n| PA | ~10% | Yes | |\n| RI | 16% | Yes | |\n| SC | 125% | Yes | Highest in nation |\n| VT | ~38% | Yes | Increased to 100% for childless in 2025 |\n| WI | Variable | Yes | Varies by children |\n\n### States with UNIQUE/NON-STANDARD Structures\n\n#### California (CA) - CalEITC\nCalifornia does NOT simply match the federal EITC. Instead:\n- Uses an **85% adjustment factor** applied to a state-specific calculation\n- Has **different phase-in rates by number of children**:\n  - 0 children: 7.65%\n  - 1 child: 34%\n  - 2 children: 40%\n  - 3+ children: 45%\n- Has a **two-stage phase-out** structure\n- Maximum credit is lower than federal EITC\n- **Fully refundable**\n\n#### Minnesota (MN) - Working Family Credit / Child & Working Families Credit\nMinnesota **replaced** its traditional Working Family Credit in 2023 with the **Child and Working Families Credit (CWFC)**:\n- **Two-part credit structure**:\n  1. Child Tax Credit component: Fixed amount per qualifying child\n  2. Working Family Credit component: Phase-in based on earnings\n- Combined amounts phase out together based on AGI or earnings\n- **Completely independent calculation** from federal EITC\n- **Fully refundable**\n\n#### Washington (WA) - Working Families Tax Credit (WFTC)\nWashington has **no income tax** and therefore no traditional EITC. Instead:\n- Provides a **flat dollar amount** based on number of children:\n  - 0 children: $300-$325\n  - 1 child: $600-$640\n  - 2 children: $900-$965\n  - 3+ children: $1,200-$1,290\n- Phases out starting **$2,500-$5,000 below** federal EITC AGI limits\n- Requires claiming federal EITC to qualify\n- **Fully refundable**\n\n#### Virginia (VA) - Split Refundable/Non-Refundable + Low-Income Tax Credit\nVirginia has the most complex structure:\n- **Non-refundable match**: 20% of federal EITC (since 2006)\n- **Refundable match**: Variable (0% → 15% → 20% → 15% over different years)\n- **Alternative Low-Income Tax Credit (LITC)**: $300 per personal exemption\n- Taxpayers receive the **better of** EITC match or LITC\n- Separate filers receive prorated credits\n\n#### Delaware (DE) - Choice Between Refundable and Non-Refundable\nDelaware requires taxpayers to **choose one**:\n- **Refundable option**: 4.5% of federal EITC\n- **Non-refundable option**: 20% of federal EITC\n- Cannot claim both\n\n#### Maryland (MD) - Differentiated by Family Status\nMaryland varies match percentages by family composition:\n- **Married OR has children**: \n  - Non-refundable: 50%\n  - Refundable: 25-45%\n- **Childless unmarried filers**: Different (lower) percentages\n- Has separate parameters for different filing situations\n\n### States WITHOUT State EITC Programs\nThe following states have **no state EITC**: AL, AK, AZ, AR, FL, GA, ID, KY, MS, NV, NH, NC, ND, SD, TN, TX, UT, WV, WY"

Credit = (earned income × 7.65%)\n4. **Full amount**: At the plateau - receiving maximum credit (~$632 for childless in 2024)\n5. **Partially phased out**: Income is above the phase-out threshold, receiving reduced credit\n6. **Fully phased out**: Income is too high; credit is reduced to $0\n\n### Childless Worker EITC Parameters (2024)\n- Maximum credit: ~$632\n- Phase-in rate: 7.65%\n- Phase-out starts at: ~$9,800 (single), ~$16,400 (married)\n- Phase-out rate: 7.65%\n- Age requirements: 25-64 years old (or 19+ if former foster youth/homeless)\n\n### State EITC Programs\nSee the State EITC Programs section at the beginning of this notebook for detailed information on each state's program, including states with unique structures (CA, MN, WA, VA, DE, MD)."
