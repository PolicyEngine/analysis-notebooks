    "## Overview\n",
    "This notebook analyzes **childless tax units** (those with no EITC-qualifying children) across all 50 US states + DC, categorizing them by where they fall on the EITC schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What This Notebook Does\n",
    "1. **Loads state-specific microdata** from PolicyEngine's HuggingFace repository\n",
    "2. **Filters to childless filers** (eitc_child_count == 0)\n",
    "3. **Checks EITC eligibility** (age requirements, SSN, investment income limits)\n",
    "4. **Categorizes each household** into one of 6 phase statuses\n",
    "5. **Calculates weighted counts and percentages** by state\n",
    "6. **Exports summary data** to CSV files\n",

    "#### Virginia (VA) - Split Refundable/Non-Refundable + Low-Income Tax Credit\n",
    "Virginia has the most complex structure:\n",
    "- **Non-refundable match**: 20% of federal EITC (since 2006)\n",
    "- **Refundable match**: Variable (0% → 15% → 20% → 15% over different years)\n",
    "- **Alternative Low-Income Tax Credit (LITC)**: $300 per personal exemption\n",
    "- Taxpayers receive the **better of** EITC match or LITC\n",

    "Delaware requires taxpayers to **choose one**:\n",
    "- **Refundable option**: 4.5% of federal EITC\n",
    "- **Non-refundable option**: 20% of federal EITC\n",
    "- Cannot claim both\n",

    "- **Tax unit weights** represent the number of actual tax units each record represents in the population\n",
    "- All monetary values are weighted averages/totals reflecting the full population\n",

    "1. **Ineligible**: Does not meet EITC eligibility requirements (age 25-64, valid SSN, investment income limits, or filing status)\n",
    "2. **No earned income**: Eligible for EITC but has zero earned income (cannot receive credit without earnings)\n",
    "3. **Pre-phase-in**: Earned income is below the level needed to receive the maximum credit. Credit = (earned income × 7.65%)\n",
    "4. **Full amount**: At the plateau - receiving maximum credit (~$632 for childless in 2024)\n",
    "5. **Partially phased out**: Income is above the phase-out threshold, receiving reduced credit\n",
    "6. **Fully phased out**: Income is too high; credit is reduced to $0\n",

    "### Childless Worker EITC Parameters (2024)\n",
    "- Maximum credit: ~$632\n",
    "- Phase-in rate: 7.65%\n",
    "- Phase-out starts at: ~$9,800 (single), ~$16,400 (married)\n",
    "- Phase-out rate: 7.65%\n",
