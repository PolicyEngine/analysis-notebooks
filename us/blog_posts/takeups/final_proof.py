The bug is NOT in the aggregation method itself.
The bug is that the RAW VALUES change when they shouldn't.

Evidence:
- Person-level values: UNCHANGED (stays at 9758 persons eligible)
- Tax-unit counts BEFORE bug: sum to 9758 (matching persons)
- Tax-unit counts AFTER bug: sum to 40228 (4x increase!)

This means tax units are getting EXTRA eligible persons added
that don't exist at the person level.

HYPOTHESIS: The bug is in how PolicyEngine caches aggregated values.

When calculating 2026 with map_to="tax_unit":
1. It calculates person-level values for 2026
2. It aggregates to tax-unit level for 2026
3. It caches this aggregation mapping

When calculating 2025 with map_to="tax_unit":
1. It calculates person-level values for 2025 (correct)
2. It tries to aggregate to tax-unit level
3. BUG: It reuses or corrupts the cached aggregation from 2026
4. Result: Wrong aggregation produces inflated counts

This explains:
- Why person-level stays correct
- Why tax-unit level gets corrupted
- Why it only happens after calculating a future year
- Why it affects multiple variables (all use same aggregation cache)
